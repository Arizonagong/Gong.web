## Albert-Barabasi model

```{r}
library(igraph)
```

# Creating network dataset with Barabasi-Albert model

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
A<-sample_pa(100, power=3, m=2, directed=FALSE, algorithm = "psumtree")
A
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
