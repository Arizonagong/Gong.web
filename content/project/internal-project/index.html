<h2><strong>Bibliographic Data Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>I am interested in collecting, processing, and analyzing large-sized web-based textual data. The bibliographic data retrievable from the web journal databases such as Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus is one of the textual data source I usually work with, comprised of author, institution, keyword, citation, and abstract information.</p>

<h2><strong>My Dissertation Research Project</strong></h2>
<p>My dissertation research used almost 450,000 bibliographic data to see how the newly emerging technology of artificial intelligence (AI) interacts with the education at the research level. My research identified cross-referencing pattern of the two fields by analyzing the journal-journal citation network.</p>

<h2><strong>Implication of the Research</strong></h2>
<p>This study is meaningful in two ways. First this study quantified and visualized textual data to represent educational research field in the citation network space. Figure 1 visualized cross-referencing between the two fields with the red-colored edges in the middle of the two clusters for the last 60 years. The graph on the right side indicates the interdisciplinary journals identified through community detection method. Second, this research provides a glimpse of what is the motivation and rationale behind adopting AI in various educational settings, essential background knowledge to design educational policy and program to enhance educationâ€™s AI-readiness. The findings implied that the computational and statistical representation of human and machine intelligence created a theoretical continuum between the two fields, precipitating interaction and cross-referencing.</p>
